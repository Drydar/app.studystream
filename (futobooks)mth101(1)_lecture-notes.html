            <p>Real numbers are used in everyday life to describe quantities such as age, population, etc. 
            Real numbers are represented with numbers such as;<br>

                    A real number is <b>RATIONAL</b> when it can be written as the ratio

                    </math> of two integers, where <span class="numbers">q ≠ 0.</span><br>
                    For instance, the numbers;<br>
                    <span class="numbers">
                        <math>
                            <mfrac>

                    A real number that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers is called <b>IRRATIONAL</b><br>
                    Irrational numbers have infinite non-repeating decimal representation.<br>
                </div>

                <div class="continuation">
                    For example;<br>
                    <span class="numbers">√2 = 1.4142135… ≈ 1.41<br>
                    π = 3.1415926… ≈ 3.14<br>

                We now state the basic properties of real numbers<br> 
                Let <span class="numbers">a, b and c</span> be real numbers and let the two usual operations 
                <span class="numbers"> (addition and multiplication)</span> in
                <b>R</b> be denoted by <span class="numbers"> (+) and (─)</span> respectively, then the following properties are satisfied:<br>
                <span class="numbers">   
                    <b>Closure:</b> a + b and a • b are also real numbers<br>
                    <b>Commutative law:</b> a + b = b + a <b>and</b> a • b = b • a<br>
                    <b>Associative law:</b> (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)<br>
                    <b>Distributive law:</b> a • (b + c) = (a • b) + (a • c)<br>
                    <b>Additive identity:</b> 0 is the additive identity since 0 + a = a<br>
                    <b>Multiplicative identity:</b> a is the multiplicative identity since 1 • a = a<br>
                    <b>Additive inverse:</b> The additive inverse of a is ─a. Since a + (─a) = a ─ a = 0<br>
                    <b>Multiplicative inverse:</b> The additive inverse of a is a ─ 1 since a • a ─ 1 = 1, provided a 
                    is different from 0<br>

            <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline; margin-bottom: 0px;">Graph of Real Line:</p>
                Real numbers are separated graphically by a number line <b>(real line)</b>. The point <span class="numbers">0</span> on the real is the 
                origin. Numbers to the right of <span class="numbers">0</span> are positive and numbers to the left of <span class="numbers">0</span> are negative.<br>
                The term <b>NON-NEGATIVE</b> describes a number that is either positive or zero.

            <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline; margin-bottom: 0px;">Trichotomy law of real numbers:</p>
                If <span class="numbers">a and b</span> are real numbers <span class="numbers">(i.e. a, b ϵ <b>R</b>),</span> then,<br>
                <span class="numbers">a < b  <b>or</b> a > b <b>or</b> a = b.</span><br>
                Also,<br>

                        <br><b>Rule 3:</b> If a > b and b > c  a > c <!--Till here-->

            <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline; margin-bottom: 0px;">Ordering of real numbers:</p>
                One very important property of real numbers is that they are ordered.<br>
                <b>Definition:</b> If <span class="numbers">a and b</span> are real numbers, then <span class="numbers">a</span> is less than <span class="numbers">b <b>when</b> ─a</span> is positive. 
            </div>

            <div class="continuation">
                The order is denoted by the inequality <span class="numbers">a < b.</span><br>
                This relationship can also be described by saying that <span class="numbers">b</span> is greater than <span class="numbers">a</span> and writing <span class="numbers">b > a.</span><br>
                The inequality <span class="numbers">a ≤ b</span> means that <span class="numbers">a</span> is less than or equal to <span class="numbers">b</span> and the inequality                
                <span class="numbers">b ≥ a</span> means that <span class="numbers">b</span> is greater than or equal to <span class="numbers">a</span>.<br>
                The symbols <span class="numbers"><, >, ≤ and ≥</span> are inequality symbols.
                
            <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline; margin-bottom: 0px;">Absolute value:</p> 
                The absolute value of a real number is its magnitude or distance between the origin and the point 
                representing the real number on the real line.<br>
                If <span class="numbers">a</span> is a real number, then the <b>ABSOLUTE VALUE</b> of <span class="numbers">a</span> is:<br>
                <span class="numbers">
                    |a| = {(a : a ≥ 0 - a : a < 0)}<br>
                </span>
                Notice from the definition that absolute value of a real number is never negative.<br>
                
                Example:<br>
                Evaluate the following:<br>
                <span class="numbers">
                    (a) |─5|<br> 
                    (b)
                    <math>
                        <mfrac>
                            <mi>|x|</mi>
                            <mi>x</mi>
                        </mfrac>
                    </math><br>
                </span>
            </div>

            <div class="continuation">

                <i>Put in many examples</i><br>
            <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline; margin-bottom: 0px;">Properties of absolute value:</p>
                If <span class="numbers">a, b, and c</span> are real numbers, then:<br>
                <span class="numbers">
                    |a|  ≥  0   and   |a| = 0  if  a = 0<br>
                    |–a|  =  |a|<br>
                    |ab|  =  |a||b|<br>
                    |a/b| = |a/b|;   b ≠ 0<br>
                    |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|<br>
                    |a – b|  ≥  | |a| – |b| |<br>
                    |a – c|  ≤  |a – b|  +  |b – c|<br>
                </span>
                Example 1:<br>
                Prove that if a and b are two positive numbers, then (a + b)/2 ≥ √ab<br>
