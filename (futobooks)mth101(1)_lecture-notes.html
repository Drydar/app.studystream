        <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline;">Real Numbers</p>
        <p>Real numbers are used in everyday life to describe quantities such as age, population, etc. 
            Real numbers are represented with numbers such as;<br>
            -3, 9, 0 4/3, 0.666….., 25.21√2, π∛(-32).</p>
        <p>Some important subjects of real numbers (R) are<br>
            [1, 2, 3…] set of natural numbers (N),<br>
            […, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …] set of integers (Z)<br>
            A real number is RATIONAL when it can be written as the ratio p/q of two integers, where q ≠ 0.<br>
            For instance, the numbers;<br>
            1/3 = 0.333…. ≈ 0.3, 1/8 = 0.125 and 125/111 = 1.126126…. are rational.<br>
            A real number that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers is called <b>IRRATIONAL</b><br>
            Irrational numbers have infinite non-repeating decimal representation.<br>
            For example;<br>
            √2 = 1.4142135… ≈ 1.41<br>
            π = 3.1415926… ≈ 3.14<br>

        <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline;">Field axioms of the real numbers</p>
            We now state the basic properties of real numbers<br> 
            Let a, b and c be real numbers and let the two usual operations (addition and multiplication) in
             R be denoted by (+) and (–) respectively, then the following properties are satisfied:<br>
                Closure: a + b and a . b are also real numbers<br>
                Commutative law: a + b = b + a and a.b = b.a<br>
                Associative law: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)<br>
                Distributive law: a.(b + c) = (a.b) + (a.c)<br>
                Additive identity: 0 is the additive identity since 0 + a = a<br>
                Multiplicative identity: a is the multiplicative identity since 1.a = a<br>
                Additive inverse: The additive inverse of a is –a. since a + (-a) = a – a = 0<br>
                Multiplicative inverse: The additive inverse of a is a-1 since a.a-1 = 1, provided a 
                is different from 0<br>
        <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline;">Graph of Real Line:</p>
            Real numbers are separated graphically by a number line (real line). The point 0 on the real is the 
            origin. Numbers to the right of 0 are positive and numbers to the left of 0 are negative.<br>
            The term NON-NEGATIVE describes a number that is either positive or zero.
            
        <br>(Number-line image)<br>
            
            Trichotomy law of real numbers:<br>
            Is a and b I are real numbers (i.e. a, b ϵ R), then<br>
            a < b  or  a > b  or  a  = b.<br>
            Also,<br>
                Rule 1: If a > b implies a + x > b + x<br><!--Fix correct items-->
                Rule 2: If a > b implies {█(ax>bx∶x>0@ax<bx∶x<0)}<br>
                <br>Rule 3: If a > b and b > c  a > c <!--Till here-->
            
        <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline;">Ordering of real numbers:</p>
            One very important property of real numbers is that they are ordered.<br>
            <b>Definition:</b> If a and b are real numbers, then a is less than b when b – a is positive. 
            <br>The order is denoted by the inequality a < b.<br>
            This relationship can also be described by saying that b is greater than a and writing b > a.<br>
            The inequality a ≤ b means that a is less than or equal to b and the inequality                
            b ≥ a means that b is greater than or equal to a.<br>
            The symbols <, >, ≤ and ≥ are inequality symbols.
            
        <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline;">Absolute value:</p> 
            The absolute value of a real is its magnitude or distance between the origin and the point 
            representing the real number on the real line.<br>
            If a is a real number, then the <b>ABSOLUTE VALUE</b> of a is:<br>
            |a| = {█(a∶a ≥0@-a∶a< 0)}<br>
            Notice from the definition that absolute value of a real number is never negative.<br>
            
            Example:<br>
            Evaluate the following:<br>
            (a) |–5| <br> (b) (|x|)/x  if x>0 <br> (c) (|x|)/x  if<0<br>
            <b>Solution:</b> 
            <i>Put in many examples</i><br>
        <p style="font-weight: 800; text-decoration: 2px solid underline;">Properties of absolute value:</p>
            If a, b, and c are real numbers, then:<br>
                |a|  ≥  0   and   |a| = 0  if  a = 0<br>
                |–a|  =  |a|<br>
                |ab|  =  |a||b|<br>
                |a/b| = |a/b|;   b ≠ 0<br>
                |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|<br>
                |a – b|  ≥  | |a| – |b| |<br>
                |a – c|  ≤  |a – b|  +  |b – c|<br>
            Example 1:<br>
            Prove that if a and b are two positive numbers, then (a + b)/2 ≥ √ab<br>
